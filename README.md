# bunovasitch.github.io
1. Noah Lehner, njlehner@my.waketech.edu
2. My github account and is brand new and this assignment gave me a slight idea about what it can do but im still very lost. My username is bunovasitch because thats been my gamer tag for many many years now (switch the b and the s).
3. The repository I created is the main thing connecting my assignments to the internet and able to upload quickly. 
4. It was all pretty self intuitive I just had to find where the actual clone button then the computer took care of the rest. I think one thing I will have to remember is to always "Push" the changes i made to ensure they get saved on my cloud.
